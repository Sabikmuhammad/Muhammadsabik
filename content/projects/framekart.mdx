# FrameKart: Building a Custom Frame Platform

FrameKart is my flagship product — a platform that makes ordering custom frames as simple as ordering a pizza.

## The Problem

Finding quality custom frames is complicated. Multiple consultations, unclear pricing, long wait times. I experienced this firsthand and knew there had to be a better way.

## The Solution

A platform where customers can:

- Upload their artwork
- Choose frame styles and materials
- Get instant pricing
- Track production in real-time

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript (100% type coverage)
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- Framer Motion for animations

### Backend

- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching and sessions
- S3 for image storage

### Infrastructure

- AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront)
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel for frontend deployment

## Key Metrics

- **10K+** monthly orders
- **99.9%** uptime
- **98** Lighthouse score
- **&lt;1.2s** LCP

## Lessons Learned

Building FrameKart taught me more about engineering and product than any job could. You're not just writing code — you're making decisions that directly impact revenue and user satisfaction.

The most important lesson? Ship fast, iterate faster. Don't wait for perfect.
